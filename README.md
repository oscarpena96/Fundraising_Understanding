# Fundraising_Understanding
With this excel I was able analyze the behavior of the fundraising through the years to determinate the perfect amount of money to set your goals to get the best result 
and the time of the year that has the best chances for you to complete it your goals. The tools used are common in excel but not everybody knows how to use them, they 
where the pivot tables and functions build in excel so it was a smooth analysis without any setbacks. The challenges that I can imagine are some missing information or 
inconclusive results.

What I can conclude about this analysis is that the best part of the year to launch your fundraising is at the end of spring around May and June, with those 2 months 
having 25% of all the successful fundraising. And if we move throughout the year, we can see that the worst month to launch your fundraising is December with the lowest 
successful campaigns and almost equal to the failed category with 4% chances to success.

Thatâ€™s when we only consider the date, if we see the image for outcomes based on goals you can notice that there is a tendency where if successful campaign goes up the 
failed campaign will go down so basically it is a mirror. The best amount to ask for is between $35,000 to 50,000, in these range you have a 67% chance of being 
successful, it is the second highest probability, and it has the biggest reward for your projects.

There is still a few limitations for my dataset, it cannot predict or help with anything else for your fundraising, it can only compare with other fundraising goals, time and categories.
Other information that we can provide with this dataset would be bar graphs for countries and number of successful project or bar graphs for countries and raised money, pie charts for general percentages and last one could be a box diagram to see compare successful data and failed data and see how the difference visually
